# Arduino Structs

This is a small arduino "library" made of data structures for common IO components with common functionality for myself that I find pretty helpful.

See [SametHopeStructs.h](https://github.com/SametHope/arduino-structs/blob/main/SametHopeStructs.h) for conventions used and a list of data structures included and more.

## Usage

1. Add all files on the repo into the relevant arduino project.
2. Include SametHopeStructs.h for all structs or include them individually.

### Misc
Clang_format_fallback Style configuration used on Visual Studio Code for formatting: 
```
{ BasedOnStyle: LLVM, UseTab: Never, IndentWidth: 2, TabWidth: 2, BreakBeforeBraces: Attach, AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: false, IndentCaseLabels: false, ColumnLimit: 0, AccessModifierOffset: -2 }
```
