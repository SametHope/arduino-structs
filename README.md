# Arduino Structs

This is a small arduino "library" made of data structures for common IO components with common functionality for myself that I find pretty helpful.

See [SametHopeStructs.h](https://github.com/SametHope/arduino-structs/blob/main/SametHopeStructs.h) for conventions used and a list of data structures included and more.

## Usage

1. Add all files on the repo into the relevant arduino project.
2. Include SametHopeStructs.h for all structs or include them individually.
